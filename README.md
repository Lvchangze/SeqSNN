## Installation
To install SeqSNN in a new conda environment:
```
conda create -n SeqSNN python=[3.8, 3.9, 3.10]
conda activate SeqSNN
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/SeqSNN/
cd SeqSNN
pip install .
```

If you would like to make changes and run your own expeirments, use:

`pip install -e .`

## Training
Take the `iSpikformer` model as an example:

`python tsforecast.py exp/forecast/ispikformer/ispikformer_electricity.yml`

You can change the `yml` configuration files as you want.

You can add, remove, or modify your model architecture in `forecaster/network/XXX.py`.

## Datasets

Metr-la and Pems-bay are available at at [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10FOTa6HXPqX8Pf5WRoRwcFnW9BrNZEIX) or [Baidu Yun](https://pan.baidu.com/s/14Yy9isAIZYdU__OYEQGa_g).
Solar and Electricity can be downloaded from  (https://github.com/laiguokun/multivariate-time-series-data).

The folder structure of this procect is as follows:
```
